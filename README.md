# Project 1: Student Management System (Python)

## Overview

This is a beginner-friendly **Student Management System** built using **Python** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. The project is designed to strengthen foundational Python skills and demonstrate clean class-based design.

This is the **first project** in my long-term journey toward **Machine Learning and AI**.
